# Rate Limiting Algorithms

## Overview

Ground implementation of rate limiting algorithms for a simple go api
1. Token Bucket Algorithm (Inspired by Alex Xu's - System Design Interview Book)
- Tokens are added at a fixed rate over time
- Implementation is in go-api/nameservice/TokenBucket.go
- If there are no tokens in the bucket, the api gets rate-limited and sends HTTP 429 response. (Too many requests)
